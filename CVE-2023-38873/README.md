# CVE-2023-38873: Clickjacking in gugaan's Economizzer  

The commit 3730880 (April 2023) of gugoan Economizzer is vulnerable to Clickjacking. Clickjacking, also known as a "UI redress attack", is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top-level page. Thus, the attacker is "hijacking" clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both.
