# CVE-2023-40619: Untrusted Deserialization in phpPgAdmin v.7.14.4 and before

phpPgAdmin <= 7.14.4 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data which may lead to remote code execution because user-controlled data is directly passed to the PHP `unserialize()` function in multiple places. An example is the functionality to manage tables in `tables.php` where the `ma[]` POST parameter is deserialized.

Discovered by Florian Walter, August 2023.
