# CVE-2024-26470: Host Header Injection in Forgot Password of FullStackHero's WebAPI Boilerplate versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1

A host header injection vulnerability exists in the forgot password functionality of FullStackHero's WebAPI Boilerplate versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1. By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This may allow an attacker to reset other users' passwords.
