# CVE-2023-38872: IDOR in gugaan's Economizzer 

An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in gugoan Economizzer commit 3730880 (April 2023) allows any unauthenticated attacker to access cash book entry attachments of any other user, if they know the Id of the attachment.

PoC: 

- We login as user `joe`, create an entry (expense/revenue) and upload an attachment. The URL of the attachment is like `<host>/attachment/4/<some_string>.jpg`
- Now, we logout and realize that we can still view `joe's` attachment by browsing to the above URL
