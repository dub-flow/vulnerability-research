#  CVE-2023-39655: Host Header Injection in Password Reset of @perfood/couch-auth version <= 0.20.0

A host header injection vulnerability exists in the NPM package @perfood/couch-auth versions <= 0.20.0. By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This may allow an attacker to reset other users' passwords and take over their accounts.

Discovered by Florian Walter, August 2023.
