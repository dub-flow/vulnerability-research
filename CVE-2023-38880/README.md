# CVE-2023-38880: Broken Access Control in OS4ED's openSIS Classic Community Edition version 9.0

The Community Edition version 9.0 of OS4ED's openSIS Classic has a broken access control vulnerability in the database backup functionality. Whenever an admin generates a database backup, the backup is stored in the web root while the file name has a format of `opensisBackup<date>.sql` (e.g. `opensisBackup07-20-2023.sql`), i.e. can easily be guessed. This file can be accessed by any unauthenticated actor and contains a dump of the whole database including password hashes.

Discovered by Florian Walter, August 2023.
